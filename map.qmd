## How to work with the map?

The map provides interactivity beyond panning an zooming.

- Clicking on a building shows opens an information about the branch it belongs to, including its description. At the same time, the branch gets highlighted in the taxonomic tree on bottom right.
- Clicking on a branch in a tree filters the map to show only that branch. You can even combine named (and coloured) levels together or dig deeper into them.
