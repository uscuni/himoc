## How to work with the map?

The map supports interactivity beyond panning and zooming.

### Taxonomy details

When you click on a building on the map, two things happen. First, you will see a popup with information about the branch (at level 3) that the building belongs to, including a short description. Second, the diagram showcasing the structure of the taxonomy in the bottom-right corner will highlight the specific branch (up to level 7) that the building belongs to.

### Taxonomy filtering

The taxonomy diagram in the bottom-right corner can also be used to filter the map. When you click a branch at a chosen level, the map will filter to show only the contents of that branch.

### Legend

In addition to the tree diagram and the popup, the names of individual branches shown on the map are available in the collapsible legend in the left control centre.

### Dark mode

If you prefer to explore the map in dark mode, you can toggle it on in the control centre. We recommend using dark mode when viewing a large-scale overview of large regions, as small, scattered development is typically more visible thanks to the higher contrast.
